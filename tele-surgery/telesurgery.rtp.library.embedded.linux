# RTP library in Embedded Linux

	- Might not necessarily need to port the entire ccRTP or uvgRTP libraries to your embedded Linux system for basic RTP encapsulation. 
	 	Here are some alternative approaches to consider:

	- There are several open-source RTP libraries specifically designed for embedded Linux systems.

	- These libraries are often smaller and more lightweight compared to their desktop counterparts, 
		making them better suited for resource-constrained environments.

	## GStreamer

		- https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/
		- https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer
		- While GStreamer offers a broader multimedia framework, it includes an RTP stack that you can leverage for your purposes. 

	
	## ERIZO (Embedded Realtime Infrastructure Zero Overhead)

		- https://github.com/btagliani/erizo 
		- A WebRTC server and signaling solution that includes an embedded-friendly RTP library)
