# Bandwidth calculation of Stereoscopic video 

	## Uncompressed rate 
 
	Resolution per eye: 1440 x 1600 pixels
	Color depth: Assuming standard 8 bits per color channel (RGB)
	Refresh rate: 90 Hz (frames per second)
	Stereo factor: 2 (left and right eye)

	"Data per frame per eye": 1440 pixels (width) * 1600 pixels (height) * 3 channels (RGB) * 8 bits/channel = 36,864,000 bits/frame
	"Data per second per eye": 36,864,000 bits/frame * 90 frames/second = 3,317,760,000 bits/second (or 3.32 Gbps)
	Total data for stereo video (uncompressed): 3.32 Gbps/eye * 2 eyes = 6.64 Gbps
	Total data for stereo video (compressed): 6.64 Gbps / 2 (compression) = 3.32 Gbps

	## Compressed rate
	
		- H.264: 5:1 to 20:1 compression ratio
		- VP9: Around 30% better compression than H.264 for similar quality
		- AV1: Can achieve even higher compression than VP9, potentially reaching 50% better than H.264
		- VP9 is specifically designed with real-time applications in mind 

		Take H.264 and 10:1 compression ratio, 
			- the bitrate for 1440p stereo video is about "330 Mbps"
			- the bitrate for 720p stereo video is about "83 Mbps"
