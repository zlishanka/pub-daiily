# GStreamer SRTP integration 


	## GStreamer Libraries

		- GStreamer provides various libraries for building custom multimedia applications. 
			The key libraries you'll need for this task include

		### gstbase
	
			- Provides core GStreamer functionalities like element creation, pipeline management, and type handling
		
		### gstelement

			- Offers functionalities specific to working with GStreamer elements
			- including creating, linking, and configuring them within your pipeline

		### gstrtp

			- This library provides support for the RTP protocol, including creating and manipulating RTP packets. 
			- (For SRTP functionality, you'll need an additional library)


		### gstrtpbin

			- offers a convenient container element for handling RTP and related protocols within your pipeline.


	## Basic integration flow 

		- Include necessary GStreamer headers
			- gstbase.h, gstelement.h, gstrtp.h

		- Initialize GStreamer: 
			- Use "gst_init" to initialize the GStreamer library

		- "Create pipeline elements":
			- Use GStreamer element factories to create the elements for your pipeline 
			- (h264parse, rtph264pay, srtpenc (from plugin or library), and udpsink).

		- Configure elements
			-  Set properties on the rtph264pay element to specify payload type and configure timestamp handling based 
				on your approach (using appsrc or custom caps).

		- Link elements
			- Link the elements together to form your pipeline (h264parse -> rtph264pay -> srtpenc -> udpsink)

		- Set SRTP key
			- Use the chosen SRTP integration method to set the encryption key for secure communication.

		- Set pipeline state
			- Set the pipeline to the "playing" state to start processing and sending the SRTP encapsulated video stream.
	
		- Handle data flow
			- Implement logic to feed your H.264 video frames (with timestamps and sequence numbers) into the pipeline. 
			- You can use "appsrc" or a custom GStreamer source element for this purpose.
		
		- Cleanup: 
			- When finished, stop the pipeline and clean up the allocated resources using GStreamer functions.
