# Companies that have telesurgery products

	several companies and organizations are developing and deploying telesurgery systems for remote surgical procedures.

	## Intuitive Da Vinci Surgical System

		- Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system has been used for robotic-assisted surgery since 1999.
		- While not exclusively designed for telesurgery, it has been used in remote surgeries
		- particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic

	## Medtronic's Mazor X

		- A surgical guidance platform that provides real-time navigation and tracking capabilities. 
		- It has been used for remote procedures, such as brain and spine surgery.

	## Verb Surgical Technologies

		- Verb is developing a telesurgery platform that enables real-time communication between surgeons and patients during remote procedures
		- Their system uses "advanced visualization and haptic feedback technology" 

	## ForAllSecure's Telesurgical Platform

		- allows surgeons to perform procedures remotely using a combination of 
		- robotics 
		- virtual reality (VR) 
		- and artificial intelligence (AI).

	## UCLA Center for Advanced Surgical Studies

		- conducting research on telesurgery and remote surgical training 
		- using advanced technologies like "VR and AR".

	## The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)

		- CERN has developed a telesurgery robot called "Cybathlon" 
		- that enables surgeons to perform operations remotely using "haptic feedback technology".

	Please note that while these products and platforms demonstrate significant advancements in telesurgery, they may not necessarily 
	be commercially available or widely adopted yet. The development of telesurgery systems is an ongoing process, and new innovations 
	are being explored and tested regularly.
