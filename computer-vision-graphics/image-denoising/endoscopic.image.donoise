# Endscopic image denoising 

	Endoscopic images are particularly challenging for denoising due to factors like 
		- limited illumination, 
		- complex internal environments, 
		- and variations in noise characteristics. 

	## General algorithms
		
		### Non-local Means (NLM) Filtering
			- leverages the redundancy in images by comparing a pixel with similar patches elsewhere in the image
			- averaging those similar patches to reduce noise while preserving details

		### Block-matching and 3D filtering
			- searches for similar image blocks and averages them for denoising
			- effective for complex textures but may introduce artifacts at block boundaries

		### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
			- CNNs can be trained on large datasets of noisy and clean images to learn the patterns of noise and remove it.
			- Variations like blind denoising CNNs that can operate without requiring perfectly noise-free training data

		### Deep Image Prior (DIP)
			- an iterative approach to reconstruct a clean image from a noisy one
			- It utilizes a deep network to learn the prior distribution of clean images and 
			- progressively refines the noisy image based on this learned prior.
