    # facial embedding 
        - create an equivalent fingerprint for the faces 
        - uses Google FaceNet 
        - tracking the detected face frame by frame based on face prints and their locations in the frame 
            - check the distance of vectors to see if it's the same person (deep sort tracking) 
            - person ID may change 
            - uses 128-bytes per face 
            - clustering 
        - solution work on video to automatically generate a checkpoint file
