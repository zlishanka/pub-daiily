    # what is optical flow 

        - Optical flow is the distribution of the apparent velocities of objects in an image. 
        - By estimating optical flow between video frames, you can measure the velocities of objects in the video. 
        - In general, moving objects that are closer to the camera will display more apparent motion than distant objects that are moving at the same speed.

    # How is it used 

        - Optical flow estimation is used in computer vision to characterize and quantify the motion of objects in a video stream, often for motion-based object detection and tracking systems. 
        - Optical flow has many applications in areas like :

            - Structure from Motion
            - Video Compression
            - Video Stabilization ...

    # Optical Flow equation 

        Optical flow works on several assumptions:

            - The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames.
            - Neighbouring pixels have similar motion.

        Consider a pixel I(x,y,t) in first frame (Check a new dimension, time, is added here. Earlier we were working with images only, so no need of time). 
        It moves by distance (dx,dy) in next frame taken after dt time. So since those pixels are the same and intensity does not change, we can say,

            I(x,y,t)=I(x+dx,y+dy,t+dt)

        Then take taylor series approximation of right-hand side, remove common terms and divide by dt to get the following equation:

            fxu+fyv+ft=0

        where 
            fx  and fy, they are image gradients. Similarly ft is the gradient along time,  
            But (u,v) is unknown. We cannot solve this one equation with two unknown variables. So several methods are provided to solve this problem and one of them is Lucas-Kanade. 


   # Lucas-Kanade method 

        - We have seen an assumption before, that all the neighbouring pixels will have similar motion. 
        - Lucas-Kanade method takes a 3x3 patch around the point. So all the 9 points have the same motion. - 
        - We can find (fx,fy,ft) for these 9 points. So now our problem becomes solving 9 equations with two unknown variables which is over-determined. 
        - A better solution is obtained with least square fit method. Below is the final solution which is two equation-two unknown problem and solve to get the solution.

        So by applying Lucas-Kanade there, we get optical flow along with the scale. 

    # Dense Optical Flow in OpenCV 

        - Lucas-Kanade method computes optical flow for a sparse feature set (in our example, corners detected using Shi-Tomasi algorithm).  
        - OpenCV provides another algorithm to find the dense optical flow. It computes the optical flow for all the points in the frame. 
        - It is based on Gunner Farneback's algorithm which is explained in "Two-Frame Motion Estimation Based on Polynomial Expansion" by Gunner Farneback in 2004.
