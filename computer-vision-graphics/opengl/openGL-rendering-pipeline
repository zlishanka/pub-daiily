## OpenGL Rendering Pipeline

    # Two graphical information 
        - Series of processing stages in order. 
        - Two graphical information, vertex-based data and pixel-based data, are processed through the pipeline, combined together then written into the frame buffer. 
        - Notice that OpenGL can send the processed data back to your application.

    
    # Vertex Operation 

        - Vertex Operation Each vertex and normal coordinates are transformed by GL_MODELVIEW matrix (from object coordinates to eye coordinates).

    # Primitive Assembly 

        - After vertex operation, the primitives (point, line, and polygon) are transformed once again by projection matrix then clipped by viewing volume clipping planes; from eye coordinates to clip coordinates
