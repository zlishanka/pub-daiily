    # what is openGL

        - is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is 
            typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.
        - Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on June 30, 1992. applications use it extensively in the fields 
            of computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video games
        - Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group 

    # GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit 

        - is a library of utilities for OpenGL programs, which primarily perform system-level I/O with the host operating system. 
        - Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of keyboard and mouse input.
        - Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including cubes, spheres and the Utah teapot. 
            GLUT also has some limited support for creating pop-up menus. 
        - The two aims of GLUT are to allow the creation of rather portable code between operating systems (GLUT is cross-platform) and to make learning OpenGL easier.
        - The original GLUT library by Mark Kilgard supports the X Window System (GLX) and was ported to Microsoft Windows (WGL) by Nate Robins
