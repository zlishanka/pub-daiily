    # What is camera calibration ? 

        Camera calibration is the process of estimating intrinsic and/or extrinsic parameters. 
        The extrinsic parameters represent a rigid transformation from 3-D world coordinate system to the 3-D camera’s coordinate system


        - Intrinsic parameters 
            - The intrinsic parameters represent a projective transformation from the 3-D camera’s coordinates into the 2-D image coordinates.
            - Intrinsic parameters deal with the camera's internal characteristics, such as, its focal length, skew, distortion, and image center. 
                fx, fy : focal length in pixels 
                fx = F/Px : F focal length in world units, Px size of pixel in world units 
                cx, cy : optical center (principal point) in pixels 
                s : skew coefficients, which is non-zero if the image axes are not perpenticular 
                s = fx * tan(a)

        - Extrinsic parameters 

            - Extrinsic parameters describe its position and orientation in the world. 
            - The extrinsic parameters represent a rigid transformation from 3-D world coordinate system to the 3-D camera’s coordinate system
            - The extrinsic parameters consist of a rotation, R, and a translation, t. The origin of the camera’s coordinate system is at its 
                optical center and its x- and y-axis define the image plane. 

      
    # Distortion in Camera Calibration 

        - Radial distortion 
            Radical distortion occurs when light rays bend more near the edges of a lens than they do at its optical center. The smaller the lens, the greater the distortion.
        - Tangential Distortion 
            Tangential distortion occurs when the lens and the image plane are not parallel. The tangential distortion coefficients model this type of distortion.

        - distortion_coefficients=(k1,k2, p1, p2, k3) 


    # Calibration procedure 

        The process of determining these two matrices is the calibration. Calculation of these parameters is done through basic geometrical equations. 
        The equations used depend on the chosen calibrating objects. Currently OpenCV supports three types of objects for calibration:

            Classical black-white chessboard
            Symmetrical circle pattern
            Asymmetrical circle pattern
