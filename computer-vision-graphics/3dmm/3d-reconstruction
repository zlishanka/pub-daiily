    # 3D reconstruction from multiple images 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction_from_multiple_images 

        It is the creation of three-dimensional models from a set of images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes.  The essence of an image is a projection 
        from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, during which process the depth is lost.

        - From a single image, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to the image point.  
        - If two images are available, then the position of a 3D point can be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. This process is referred to as triangulation. 
        - The key for this process is the relations between multiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of points must contain some structure and 
          that this structure is related to the poses and the calibration of the camera. 

        Many existing systems for constructing 3D models are built around specialized hardware (e.g. stereo rigs) resulting in a high cost, which cannot satisfy the requirement of its 
        new applications. This gap stimulates the use of digital imaging facilities (like a camera). 

        - An early method was proposed by Tomasi and Kanade.[2] They used an affine factorization approach to extract 3D from images sequences. 
        - However, the assumption of orthographic projection is a significant limitation of this system. 

        processing 

            - Camera calibration consists of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, 
            - Depth determination serves as the most challenging part in the whole process, The correspondence problem, finding matches between two images so the position 
              of the matched elements can then be triangulated in 3D space is the key issue here.
            - Once you have the multiple depth maps you have to combine them to create a final mesh by calculating depth and projecting out of the camera – registration. 
            - By the stage of Material Application you have a complete 3D mesh, which may be the final goal, but usually you will want to apply the color from the original 
                photographs to the mesh

     Introduction

        - Existing solutions are not fully satisfying
            - User-driven modeling: long and error-prone
            - 3D scanners: costly and cumbersome 

        - Alternative: analyzing image sequences 
            - Cameras are cheap and lightweight
            - Cameras are precise (several megapixels)

        The objective of this report is to identify the various approaches to generating sparse 3D reconstructions using

        - the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms and 
        - the methods to generate dense 3D reconstructions using the Multi View Stereo (MVS) algorithms.

        existing open-source 

        - majority of the current toolkits are based on the Bundler package. Bundler generates a sparse 3D reconstruction of the scene. For dense 3D reconstruction, 
        the preferred approach seems to be to use the multi view stereo packages CMVS and PMVS, developed by Y. Furukawa 

            Bundler: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/ 

        - Several packages are available for visualization of point clouds, notably MeshLab, CloudCompare and the Point Cloud Library (PCL) which integrates nicely with OpenCV.

        - Depth Perception with Deep Learning
        - beings with vision and so as Elon said, ‘these costly sensors would become pointless once we solve vision’.
        -  There’s huge research going on in this field of depth perception with vision, especially with the advancements in Machine Learning and 
            Deep Learning we are now able to compute depth just from vision at high accuracy.

        Automated 3D Face Reconstruction from Multiple Images using  Quality Measures 
            - Algorithms that reconstruct 3D faces from images by fitting a deformable face model, such as a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), rely on a relatively precise initial positioning 
                of the face [7] or on a set of feature point coordinates [8]. 
            - The feature point detection is a non-trivial task, especially if the image material includes complex lighting, facial expressions, wrinkles, eye glasses or facial hair

        Face Recognition Based on Fitting a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) 

            - Complete separation of shape and orientation is achieved by fitting a deformable 3D model to images
            - The face recognition system presented in this paper combines deformable 3D models with a computer graphics simulation of projection and illumination
            - give a comprehensive description of the algorithms involved in 
                1) constructing the morphable model from 3D scans (Section 3), 
                2) fitting the model to images for 3D shape reconstruction (Section 4), which includes a novel algorithm for parameter optimization (Appendix B), and 
                3) measuring similarity of faces for recognition (Section 5).
