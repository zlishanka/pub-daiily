# Data transfer between CPU and GPU on Jetson platform

	- Nvidia Jetson platforms don't have a single, dedicated memory management module for CPU-GPU data transfer. 
	- However, the system architecture facilitates this transfer through a combination of hardware and software features:

	## Shared Memory
		- Jetson uses a unified memory space
		- Both CPU and GPU can access the same physical memory through the shared memory controller.

	## Memory Management Unit (MMU)
		- MMU translates virtual memory addresses used by software into physical memory addresses for hardware access.
		- Allows the CPU and GPU to use different virtual addresses while accessing the same physical memory location 

	## CUDA Programming Model
		- Memory management is handled through CUDA APIs
		- APIs allow allocating memory on the host (CPU) or device (GPU) and transferring data between them

	## Unified Memory
		- hardware cache coherence is available
		- same virtual address space is used for both CPU and GPU.
		- The system automatically manages data coherency behind the scenes
