    # DNN module in library 

        - Deep Learning is the most popular and the fastest growing area in Computer Vision nowadays. 
        - Since OpenCV 3.1 there is DNN module in the library that implements forward pass (inferencing) with deep networks, pre-trained using 
            some popular deep learning frameworks, such as Caffe. 
        - In OpenCV 3.3 the module has been promoted from opencv_contrib repository 
        - import cv2 print cv2. __version__
