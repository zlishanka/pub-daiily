# Mutex vs Semaphore
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd8b9Fr0Xbo 

	- both are to help synchronization 
	- mutex 
		- allows one thread into critical section
		- locked/unlocked
		- locking mechanism
		- used for mutual exclusion
 
	- semaphore 
		- allows multiple threads into their own critical sections
		- use count 
		- singaling mechanism 
		- might have multiple resources shared by multiple threads
			only allow limited count of threads to access resources
