## Adapter pattern 

    Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability 
    of two independent interfaces. This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.  

    A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop.
