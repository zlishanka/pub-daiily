-[YOLOE: Open-Set Object Detection & Segmentation without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07465)
    - YOLO are fast and accurate but limited to predefined categories. 
    - Open-set methods address this but often sacrifice efficiency. 
    - YOLOE changes this by integrating text, visual, and prompt-free detection into a single, highly efficient model—achieving real-time “see anything” capability.
    - **Text Prompts** – RepRTA refines embeddings with zero inference overhead.
    - **Visual Prompts** – SAVPE enhances visual embeddings with minimal complexity.
    - **Prompt-Free** – LRPC detects all objects efficiently, without language model dependencies.
