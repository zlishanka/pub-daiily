    - It can query logs from multiple remote machines simultaneously, filter them by time range and patterns, and draw timeline histograms for quick visual insight.
    - Nerdlog establishes an SSH connection to every node that the user wants to collect logs from and keeps them idle in the background so there's no need for a centralized server.
