- [What Happened to the Revolution?](https://x.com/ohmzeus/status/1916190873425219735?utm_source=tldrcrypto)
    - The original promise of cryptocurrency—financial sovereignty—has been eclipsed by an emphasis on infrastructure over native monetary design. 
    - DeFi has gravitated toward dollar-denominated stablecoins and institutional adoption.
    - Lacking mechanisms for supply, stability, and credit management, tokens like BTC and ETH have ceded ground to traditional financial models.
    - Layer-1 tokens are increasingly commoditized, risking long-term value erosion.
    - Reviving the crypto revolution requires building tokens with complete monetary systems rather than simply creating better rails for existing money.

- [Stablecoins are speedrunning commoditization](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1915758735135330563.html?utm_source=tldrcrypto)
    - Stablecoins are rapidly becoming commoditized utilities as issuers compete to distribute yield to users and incentivize partners.
    - Leading players like Tether—backed by deep liquidity—are expected to pass on yields as competitive pressure increases. 
    - Meanwhile, payment-optimized chains will generate returns through validator fees and custom protocols. 
    - Over time, apps and exchanges will abstract stablecoins under a “USD” label, auto-routing funds to the best-yielding source.

- [Vitalik and Balaji Predictions ](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1914677028743487818.html?utm_source=tldrcrypto)
    - DeFi is becoming safer but not safe yet.
    - The dollar is not as safe as you think. Stablecoins are infrastructure now
    - Crypto doesn’t weaken the dollar but it exposes it.
    - Once fiat goes online first it loses its geographic monopoly. Fiat dies like newspapers did (slowly, then all at once)
    - Vitalik: “AGI is real when it builds a profitable company.”  Balaji agrees: AI isn’t goal seeking but it’s pattern-matching.
    - DeSci = the DeFi of medicine. Today’s health system profits from illness. DeSci flips that.
    - The system won’t reform. It will be rebuilt. The next one won’t be built in DC. It’ll be coded. On chain.
