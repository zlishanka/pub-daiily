    - The original promise of cryptocurrency—financial sovereignty—has been eclipsed by an emphasis on infrastructure over native monetary design. 
    - DeFi has gravitated toward dollar-denominated stablecoins and institutional adoption.
    - Lacking mechanisms for supply, stability, and credit management, tokens like BTC and ETH have ceded ground to traditional financial models.
    - Layer-1 tokens are increasingly commoditized, risking long-term value erosion.
    - Reviving the crypto revolution requires building tokens with complete monetary systems rather than simply creating better rails for existing money.

- [Stablecoins are speedrunning commoditization](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1915758735135330563.html?utm_source=tldrcrypto)
    - Stablecoins are rapidly becoming commoditized utilities as issuers compete to distribute yield to users and incentivize partners.
    - Leading players like Tether—backed by deep liquidity—are expected to pass on yields as competitive pressure increases. 
    - Meanwhile, payment-optimized chains will generate returns through validator fees and custom protocols. 
    - Over time, apps and exchanges will abstract stablecoins under a “USD” label, auto-routing funds to the best-yielding source.
