## Cursor tips 

### Add to chat 
- Select code and press `COMMAND+L` or `COMMAND+SHIFT+L` to add multiple pieces of code to the chat context.

### @ mentions
- Use the `“@” symbol` either in the code writing/editing or in the chat, so you can reference with objects like specific files or classes.

### Codebase reference
- In that chat, use the option to reference the whole base rather than the current file (this will be more expensive but can give you a better solution by understanding multiple files and the suggestions can be across files).
- This can be done with by clicking the with codebase button or pressing `COMMAND + ENTER`.

### Scope of changes

### Documentation
- If Cursor does not understand a library or tool that is out of the training data, then you can give it a URL for a documentation page.

### Upload images
- You cannot upload an image to the prompt like with other genAIs but you can reference a file in your project with GPT-4. 
- use prompt like `build app with plain HTML and CSS and JS`
