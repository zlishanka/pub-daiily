	## General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) 

		- Task Scheduling
		- Resource management 
			- virtual resources like Files, libraries, folders
			- allow applications/processes to access
		- Device drivers
			- external diskes
			- response to keyboard, mouses
			- draw graph on monitor

		- Windows, MacOS, Linux, IOS/Android
		- human interaction are most import features
			- sheduler is designed to prioritize these tasks, non-deterministic
			- some tasks might be pushed back, lag

	## Real Time Operating System (RTOS)
		
		- scheduler is desgined to meet scrict timing deadline
		- might need to write device drivers, file system 
		- Super loop structured (microcontroller) 
		- ISR to handle external events, 
		- ISR is also used for strict time constraint tasks ( < 1ms )
		- For tasks like 100ns, might need custom hardware like FPGA
		- Downside of Superloop - cannot run tasks concurrently
	
		- RTOS - running multiple tasks at the same time on multi-core processor
			- microcontroller has limitation to run tasks on one core
			- can also give higher priority to some tasks
		
		
		### Why we need RTOS
			- to be able to run multi tasks concurrently
			- 

	## Popular RTOS 

		- FreeRTOS: Considered the most popular RTOS, 
			- FreeRTOS is known for being free, open-source, and lightweight. 
			- It's a great choice for microcontrollers with limited resources.		 

		- Zephyr: Another open-source option, 
			- Zephyr is gaining traction and is used by companies like Google and Meta.

		- VxWorks: A commercial RTOS known for its reliability and maturity, 
			- VxWorks is a good choice for demanding industrial applications.

		- Micrium OS (includes ÂµC/OS): A family of commercial RTOS options from Micrium, 
			- offering different levels of features and complexity for various embedded system needs.

		- ThreadX: Owned by Microsoft, 
			- ThreadX is a commercial RTOS known for its good performance and ease of use.
