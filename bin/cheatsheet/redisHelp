##    By using Homebrew, you greatly reduce the cost of setting up and configuring the development environment on Mac OS X. 

# homebrew install 

    brew install redis 

# Launch Redis on computer starts.

    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

# Start Redis server via “launchctl”.

    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

# Start Redis server using configuration file. 

    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

# Stop Redis on autostart on computer start. 

    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

# Location of Redis configuration file.

    /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

# Get redis information 

    brew info redis
