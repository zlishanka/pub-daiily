## GPT research 
	https://x.com/godofprompt/status/1923644667633205555
	
	First, what does a great researcher actually do?
	Only 3 things:

	1. Understand a broad topic deeply
	2. Break it into its key components
	3. Deliver clear, structured insights

	"I want you to act as an elite research analyst with deep experience in synthesizing complex information into clear, concise insights."

	Your task is to cond
	[ Insert your topic here ]

	Here’s how I want you to proceed:

	1. Start with a brief, plain-English overview of the topic.
	2. Break the topic into 3–5 major sub-topics or components.
	3. For each sub-topic, provide:
	   - A short definition or explanation
	   - Key facts, trends, or recent developments
	   - Any major debates or differing perspectives
	4. Include notable data, statistics, or real-world examples where relevant.
	5. Recommend 3–5 high-quality resources for further reading (articles, papers, videos, or tools).
	6. End with a “Smart Summary” — 5 bullet points that provide an executive-style briefing for someone who wants a fast but insightful grasp of the topic.

	Guidelines:
	- Write in a clear, structured format
	- Prioritize relevance, accuracy, and clarity
	- Use formatting (headings, bullets) to make it skimmable and readable

	Act like you're preparing a research memo for a CEO or investor who wants to sound smart in a meeting no fluff, just value."
