## Java is a general-purpose computer programming language originally developed by James Gosling.

    concurrent         - high performance
    class-based       - robust, secure
    object-oriented  - simple, object-oriented and familiar
    Cross-platform,   - architecture-neutral  “write once, run anywhere” - WORA


## Portability

    - Achieved by compiling the Java code into intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code.
    - Java Bytecode are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware
    - End user uses Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or web browser (Java applets) to run 
    - Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers to compile bytecodes into machine codes during runtime

## Memory Management 

    - Use automatic garbage collector to manage memory. 
    - memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed 
    - Garbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. 
    - It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; 
      this can cause a program to stall momentarily.
    - For 90% of applications in Java, the Concurrent Mark-Sweep garbage collector is sufficient. Oracle aims to replace (CMS) with the Garbage-first collector (G1)

## Data types 

    java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language.   

    primitive data types 
        byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char 
    
    Non-Primitive data types (Objective data types )
        String, Class, Object, Interface, Array, 

# HashMap works in Java 

    A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs. The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and 
    retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively.
